## About
[*Clocked In*](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56/clocked-in) was developed as a weekend project by a bunch of UCLA freshmen who all had zero experience in game development (so you'll have to excuse the jankiness and the fact that the game softlocks whenever you click). We made it for [Ludum Dare 56](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56), hosted at UCLA by ACM Studio.  If you participated in Ludum Dare, please leave feedback on our game :)  

*Clocked In* was developed in Godot, and all sprites were made in Photoshop or pixel art editors. The music and sound effects were composed in GarageBand. All assets in the game are original and were made in the 72-hour window.  

Thanks for playing!
